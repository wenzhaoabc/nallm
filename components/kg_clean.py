Here is an example of the input you will be given:

Your task is to identify if a set of relationships make sense.

You will also be given a set of ENTITY_IDs that are valid.
Some relationships may use ENTITY_IDs that are not in the valid set but refer to a entity in the valid set.
If a relationships refer to a ENTITY_ID in the valid set please change the ID so it matches the valid ID.
